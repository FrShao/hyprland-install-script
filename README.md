## About
This script is used to automatically setup [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) with [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) tiling window manager, [Qogir Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Qogir-theme), my dotfiles and install additional software that I use.

## Installation
- [Download](https://endeavouros.com/) EndeavourOS from the official website.
- Follow the instructions on how to install it.
- I recommend that you pick `Online` installation and go with `No Desktop`.

After the installation is done, login to your system, and clone this repository:

``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/while1618/endeavouros-setup.git 
$ cd endeavouros-setup/ 
```

Before running the script, you should check `setup.sh` and configure it to you needs.

_Be sure to know what you are doing, because changing `setup.sh` can break things._

Once you are finished, start the setup with:

``` 
$ ./setup.sh
```
